Python Functions is a block of statements that return the specific task. 
The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can do the function calls to reuse code contained in it over and over again.

Some Benefits of Using Functions:

Increase Code Readability 
Increase Code Reusability

Types of Functions in Python:
Built-in library function: These are Standard functions in Python that are available to use.
User-defined function: We can create our own functions based on our requirements.
Creating a Function in Python

We can add any type of functionalities and properties to it as we require.
By the following example, we can understand how to write a function in Python.
In this way we can create Python function definition by using def keyword.
